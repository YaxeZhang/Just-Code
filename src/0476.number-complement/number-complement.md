<p>Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.</li>
<li>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 5
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 1
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
